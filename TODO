DONE - reinject on dom change
- grab variant choices automatically
- be clearer about the fact that we save the user money in the documentation.
- find approximate shipping costs + taxes for each retailer, and take into cost accounts
- move non-essential logic into another file, or into API call


THINGS WE NEED TO GRAB PER RETAILER FOR ULTIMATE VISION:
  REQUIRED:
    -tax price. estimate as 5%. 
    -shipping price. learn retailer rules for different price ranges. 
    -
  COOL:
    -gift receipt
  SHIT THAT WOULD BE NICE BUT HOW???
    -gift wrapping, gift message



FUTURE:
-make it possible to add to zinc cart
  -each popup is the same, but with "add to cart" and "view cart"
  -"view cart" page on options, compiling savings, along with button to check out
